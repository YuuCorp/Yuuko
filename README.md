Yuuko is a free and open source Discord bot that integrates with the AniList API, providing the users with useful commands for viewing anime, manga, getting recommendations, viewing AniList users profiles without opening a browser tab, and many more. Yuuko is the product of two bots being merged together (AniSuggest by [TibixDev](https://github.com/TibixDev), [Sayykii](https://github.com/sayykii), and TheCultureMan by [crackheadakira](https://github.com/crackheadakira)). It is actively maintained.

## Installation

### Simple Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YuuCorp/Yuuko.git
```
2. Install all the dependencies ([install bun](https://bun.sh/))
```bash
$ bun i
```
3. Edit the file called `.env.local` and change the `TOKEN` in it
```bash
$ cp .env .env.local
```
4. To create the Dragonfly database, you first need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), after that follow the instructions on the [Dragonfly repo](htt:PEPE://github.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly/tree/main/contrib/docker#step-1), make sure the default port(6379) is used for the Dragonfly instance.  
5. Create the sqlite queries and make an empty db
```bash
$ bun db:generate
$ bun db:push
``` 
6. Start the bot
```bash
$ bun run dev
```

### PM2 Container Installation (Linux)

1. Make sure `TRUSTED_USERS` includes your Discord ID in `.env.local`, so you can update the bot if needed.
2. Do the same as in **Simple Installation**, except instead of running `bun run start`, run `sh start.sh`.
3. You can update the bot by running the `update` command. (Rebooting will be included in the future)

## Configuration

- You can disable certain commands by changing their `.ts` prefix, or by deleting the command file entirely. Beware though, some commands like `anime` and `manga` are hooked into by other commands, so deleting hookable commands will also cause those to break.


## Contribution

Feel free to create pull requests for any improvements you feel like making, but only do so if they have to do with the core idea of the bot, and they implement/fix actual functionality. In your pull request you should ideally describe what you changed, and why changed it.
