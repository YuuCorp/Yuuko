<span style="font-size:11px;"><em>Image via <a href="https://youtu.be/KAVU-tvHpyk" target="_blank"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Power Rangers Official</strong></span></a></em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most people tend to celebrate National <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em> Day (August 28), by first asking out loud: &ldquo;Wait, there is a National <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em> Day &hellip;?&rdquo; and then realizing that OF COURSE there is a National <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em> Day. After all, this is the franchise that changed the game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Saban Entertainment first took <strong><em>Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger</em></strong> &mdash; part of the Japanese <em><strong>Super Sentai</strong></em> series that&rsquo;s been on the air since 1975 &mdash; and spliced its <strong><a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2020/08/09-1/feature-the-original-japanese-show-that-gave-us-power-rangers-is-the-greatest-thing-in-existence" target="_blank"><span style="color:#f39c12;">martial arts/robot-monster fight scenes</span></a></strong> into original footage of American actors to create a first-of-its-kind hybrid show, they stumbled upon something magical. The resulting <em><strong>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</strong></em> took the world by storm and spawned sequel after sequel. But which American remix of <em><strong>Super Sentai</strong></em> was the best? The answer will be different depending on who you ask but, for our money, these&nbsp;five series are definitely contenders:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:26px;"><em><strong>Power Rangers Dino Thunder</strong></em></span></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-TJuQOvDQw" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 12th season of <em><strong>Power</strong></em> <em><strong>Rangers</strong></em>,&nbsp;<em><strong>Dino</strong></em> <em><strong>Thunder</strong></em>, felt almost like a soft reboot/remake of <em><strong>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</strong></em> that simultaneously took itself more and less seriously. On the one hand, the series lampshaded a lot of the sillier elements from the series that started it all like by (lovingly) poking fun at how stereotypically some of its main characters acted in the beginning. But then the series let them grow, taking the best elements of <em><strong>MMPR</strong></em> and refining them into one of the most unforgettable parts of the franchise. A big part of that was due to the return of Jason David Frank as Tommy Oliver but there were other great things about <em><strong>Dino Thunder</strong></em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main villain, Mesogog, for one, was more than your typical &ldquo;evil thing coming down from space to do evil things&rdquo; bad guy. He still had that over-the-top&nbsp;flare we love and is probably one of the more lethal Ranger foes out there, but there is also a tragedy to him that was a real breath of fresh air. Combined with solid performances from the main cast, <em><strong>Dino Thunder</strong></em> more than earned its shot at the title of the best <em><strong>Power Ranger</strong></em> show ever.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:26px;"><em><strong>Power Rangers RPM</strong></em></span></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6jOunzJd54M" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>RPM</strong></em> was one of the earliest <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em> shows where the villains felt really scary. Not just cool-looking, or tragic, or well-acted, but actually menacing. Destroying/enslaving 99 percent of humanity is a pretty impressive accomplishment from a franchise that started with a Moon Witch who couldn&rsquo;t even destroy one town in California.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say <em><strong>RPM</strong></em> was a sci-fi horror or anything like that. Sure, it was a post-apocalyptic show, but it retained a lot of the signature <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em> goofiness, always finding that perfect balance between camp and genuine human moments. The PR vehicles might not have been the best the franchise ever produced, but the weapons of the individual Rangers were what every kid who watched the show wanted for Christmas. Plus, we never got tired of listening to the voice of Venjix, the <em><strong>RPM</strong></em> Big Bad. Still sounds so cool after all these years.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:26px;"><em><strong>Power Rangers S.P.D.</strong></em></span></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nSrX-HDdync" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Disney was on a roll in the early 2000s since <em><strong>Dino Thunder</strong></em> was immediately followed by another amazing <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em> show: <em><strong>S.P.D</strong></em>.&nbsp;A police-themed&nbsp;series, one of the greatest accomplishments of <em><strong>S.P.D.</strong></em> is how well it&rsquo;s managed to juggle its massive cast. With the addition of Rangers like Shadow, Omega, or Nova, the show had nine main characters and still successfully gave each and every one of them as much screen time and attention as they needed for the viewers to care about them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>S.P.D.</strong></em> was also expansive in its setting and worldbuilding, and with it taking place in the future and dealing with aliens, it was one of the first <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em> shows that had an almost space opera feel to it. The storylines were epic and grand, the characters believable, and there was even a solid mystery element to this incarnation of the <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em>. What more can you ask for?<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:26px;"><em><strong>Power Rangers Ninja Steel</strong></em></span></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5UgSKSXtjs" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Ninja Steel</strong></em> attempted to do a lot of things at once. It sort of tried to capture the tone and energy of <em><strong>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</strong></em> only with better effects and acting, much like <em><strong>Dino Thunder</strong></em>. But it also took a lot of elements from the original <em><strong>Super Sentai</strong></em> shows, like the cowboy hat-wearing StarNinger from <em><strong>Shuriken Sentai Ninninger</strong></em>, and transplanted them into the show instead of adapting them into a new setting. It seemed like their goal was to celebrate and embrace what made <em><strong>Super Sentai</strong></em> so popular in Japan, which was admirable. The final hook was some of the best effects in all of <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em>, particularly with the villains and the attacks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Individually, all of those elements were the peak of <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em>&rsquo; creativity and storytelling. The problem was that they didn&rsquo;t always jive together, and that&rsquo;s what ultimately held the series back from being a masterpiece. All the right parts are still there, though, and you can constantly sense the potential for <em><strong>Ninja Steel</strong></em> to be the greatest <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em> show ever. To some, that&rsquo;s more than enough.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:26px;"><em><strong>Power Rangers in Space</strong></em></span></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtHdFyqQi6A" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For many of us, <em><strong>Power Rangers in Space</strong></em> was the first time we started realizing that <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em> could be more than just a goofy and colorful pitstop on the road from enjoying cartoons to live-action shows. The sixth <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em> season didn&rsquo;t exactly come without any homework, banking on the viewers&rsquo; knowledge of the previous installments of the franchise, but it then brought them all to their most satisfying conclusions. After all, it was the show that made Bulk and Skull &hellip; cool, in that one scene? Wait, how on Earth is that possible? It&rsquo;s not. But <em><strong>In Space</strong></em> it is. (No refunds.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>In Space </strong></em>effectively ended the Zordon era of the <em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em>, and it truly went out with a bang. It felt like the perfect culmination of everything set up by <em><strong>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</strong></em>. Sure, it wasn&rsquo;t as serious as some of the later shows, but you always got the feeling that <em><strong>In Space</strong></em> was embracing its campier elements out of love for the series that by then had been on the air for five years. Admittedly, some of the appeal of <em><strong>In Space</strong></em> lies in its nostalgia factor and requires you to have an emotional connection with the shows before it. But if you have that, this is the show you will never, ever forget.</p>

<p>Set in a demanding school that only admits 10 to 20 students per year, <strong><em>Gunjou no Fanfare</em></strong> is a youth drama that follows the lives of three young men - a boy who formerly belonged to an idol group, a boy who was raised on a remote island, and a boy from England whose parents dictate his future for him - as they train to become professional horse racing jockeys. Can they make it through three years of schooling that tests not only their motor skills and academic prowess, but also their physical attributes as well?</p>

   <title>BEASTARS Creator Paru Itagaki Draws Official Illustration for The Suicide Squad Film</title>
   <author>Daryl Harding</author>
   <description>Itagaki said it was "dazzling to see the villains leave their moral values behind and go on a rampage"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/dcd1e89c5b203eb1c8f221633fe76daf1630144530_thumb.png"  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BEASTARS&lt;/em&gt; creator Paru Itagaki already has a handle on drawing some monstrous creatures in her own series, which is probably the reason why Warner Bros. went to the award-winning manga creator to draw an official illustration for &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;Japanese release.

   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>BEASTARS</strong></em> creator <strong>Paru Itagaki</strong> already has a handle on drawing some monstrous creatures in her own series, which is probably the reason why Warner Bros. went to the award-winning manga creator to draw an official illustration for <strong><em>The Suicide Squad&#39;s</em></strong> Japanese release. <strong>Itagaki&#39;s</strong> poster shows Harley Quinn wearing her manic grin and King Shark just wanting food.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="The Suicide Squad" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/c14e3c91270e60d0e580c93e81f099961630144513_main.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 929px;" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Itagaki</strong> said she was &quot;captivated by the unique villains&quot; in the film, and that it was&nbsp;&quot;dazzling to see the villains leave their moral values behind and go on a rampage.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>The Suicide Squad</strong></em> opened in Japan on August 13&nbsp;and has since made&nbsp;390&nbsp;million yen in the region, this is in contrast to <em><strong>Birds of Prey</strong></em>, which made 510 million during its run, and the first&nbsp;<em><strong>Suicide Squad</strong></em> in 2016, which made 1.76 billion yen. The dip is likely due to both the Delta variant of COVID-19 rampaging across Japan, deterring people from going to theaters, and the demographic likely to see the film not the usual type to go to the cinema.</p>

<p>The official website for <a href="https://farawaypaladin.com/"><span style="color:#f39c12;">the forthcoming TV anime adaptation</span></a> of Kanata Yanagino&#39;s fantasy light novel series <em><strong>The Faraway Paladin</strong></em> has started streaming a 60-second second PV to announce its premiere date in Japan, October 9, 2021. The TV anime is set to premiere on TOKYO MX (22:00), AT-X (23:30), and BS Nittele (24:00) on the day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

In 2007, she was selected from among 30,000 applicants at the Sony Music audition held for the theme song for the anime film <strong><em>The Garden of Sinners</em></strong>. As Hikaru, she joined the vocal unit <strong>Kalafina</strong> from its second single <strong>&quot;sprinter/ARIA.&quot;</strong> One year after Kalafina&#39;s disbandment was announced, she made her major debut under the name <strong>H-el-ical//</strong> from NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan in May 2020. As her fourth solo single, <strong>&quot;The Sacred Torch&quot;</strong> is set to be released on November 3, 2021.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The official portal site for Hiro Mashima&#39;s space opera manga <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/comics/manga/edens-zero/volumes"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><em><strong>EDENS ZERO</strong></em></span></a> announced on August 27 that its official&nbsp;channel <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1yKnXANw5tXmLkFjmhrDvw"><span style="color:#f39c12;">&quot;EDENS ZERO Channel&quot;</span></a></strong> has launched on YouTube to deliver the latest information about the TV anime and games.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The guests of its 13-minute first episode are <strong>Mikako Komatsu</strong> (Rebecca Bluegarden) and <strong>Shiki Aoki</strong> (Homura K&ocirc;getsu), who worked together for the first time in this anime&nbsp;(However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they have only met face-to-face once at a studio this year). The two share many behind-the-scenes stories about the production of the anime, provided by the staff and voice cast members.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, Shiki confessed that Miyuki Sawashiro&#39;s performance as Valkyrie was so wonderful that she cried a lot while watching her rehearsal video. Before the actual voice recording session, she had to watch the video over and over again, while crying, until she got used to it in order to concentrate on her own performance.</p>

<p>Voice actress <a href="http://king-cr.jp/artist/uesakasumire/"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Sumire Uesaka</strong></span></a> has announced&nbsp;that her next 12th single <strong>&quot;Seikatsu Konkyu Dame dinero&quot;</strong>&nbsp;(<em>Living in Poverty, Give Me Money</em>) is set to be released on October 27, 2021, and that it will be featured as the second cour OP theme for the TV anime <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/the-great-jahy-will-not-be-defeated"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><em><strong>The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!</strong></em></span></a>&nbsp;She has also voiced one of the anime&#39;s main characters, Magical Girl.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The song is written/composed by <strong>Kenichi Maeyamada</strong>, aka <strong>Hydain</strong>, a music creator who has been active in a wide range of Japanese entertainment industries. He says, &quot;I am honored to be working with Uesaka-san for the first time on this song. The song has become one that is filled with energy. Extraordinary development, too much energy! Sumipe-san is amazing at singing it! The lyrics are written from Jahy&#39;s point of view, but also has a universal message. In today&#39;s world where we can&#39;t speask aloud, shake the vocal cords of your heart! Dame dinero!&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Uesaka&#39;s official website has unveiled&nbsp;the two CD jacket photos and her new artist visual for the single. In the visuals, she wears a striking dress made up of &quot;commonplace objects,&quot; such as pull-tab crowns, aluminum corsets, and collars made with packing material.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color:#000099;"><em>In the Dark Realm, the Great Jahy was only second to the demon king. Feared by all, she was supposed to be just enjoying being endlessly willful and hedonistic, when a magical girl attacked her and blasted her to the human realm. Forced to live in poverty, her days consist of working in a bar while living in a tiny apartment without a bathroom. Blowing both pity and the demand for rent away, her ambitions are grand: Restoring the Dark Realm!</em></span></p>

   <title>Shueisha Launches World Maker Manga Creation App In Closed Beta</title>
   <author>Humberto Saabedra</author>
   <description>Closed beta launch also features contest where winning entry will be illustrated by either Romy Oishi or Shiro Usazaki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/38202ac3ce49c14e7a5b21dd4ffb9ca61630092860_thumb.png"  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shueisha&lt;/strong&gt;, in association with &lt;strong&gt;Shonen Jump+&lt;/strong&gt; is launching a very unique smartphone app designed to let anyone make manga using just their smartphone or tablet with no illustration experience required. Read on for the first details about World Maker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
</description>
   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/d85cbccbb3d4dcd52d9ad450560b4d9f1630091790_main.png" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Shueisha</strong>, in association with <strong>Shonen Jump+</strong> is launching a very unique smartphone app developed by Japanese developer Kayac Inc., under the conceit that what drives away many from attempting to draw manga, even as a hobby, is the perceived difficulty in drawing characters and making all of the elements of a manga come together, such as backgrounds, speech bubbles, effects and page layoits. With the forthcoming launch of the <strong>World Maker</strong> app beta, Shueisha is not only aiming to open up manga creation to anyone with a smartphone, they&#39;re also aiming to find the next undiscovered talent with a contest that will feature Romy Oishi or Shiro Usazaki illustrating the winning entry created with this one-of-a-kind app.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/88cc1a8450c732222f0d4b99c434f8eb1630091743_main.png" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The World Maker app, even in its Beta version will allow anyone with a smartphone or tablet the ability to create their own fully fledged short&nbsp;manga by breaking down the process into easy to understand steps and using preset templates for each step. The first step is dialogue, the next step is selecting characters, the next,&nbsp;backgrounds and so on and so forth until the manga is complete. The template count varies on the step in question, but the app features an average of hundreds of selections for each major element. However, as this closed Beta will not be available until September 8th and requires following the official World Maker Twitter account until registration closes on September 5th, it will be difficult for many to see what the app truly entails until the Open Beta begins on September 22nd.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/f7cd505edab5e74cdae3ae675561b7461630091851_main.png" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, to celebrate the launch of the Beta, Shueisha and Shonen Jump + have announced a contest in the&nbsp;World Maker Name Award where the winning entry submitted via the app&#39;s social media tools and official hashtags will be illustrated by either&nbsp;Romy Oishi or Shiro Usazaki and&nbsp;a prize package worth&nbsp;&yen;300,000, including a feature in the Shonen Jump + app. The contest runs from September 8th to October 8th&nbsp; with prize announcements in&nbsp;December. The judging panel set between Oishi, Usazaki and the editorial department of Shonen Jump+ . Below a trailer detailing many of the app&#39;s features:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>What happens when you then take Gen Urobuchi from Nitroplus and partner him with Pili International Media, the company responsible for the glove puppetry media with the highest production values?

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ever since the first character DLC for&nbsp;<em><strong>Guilty Gear Strive</strong></em> <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2021/08/16-1/guilty-gear-strive-shows-off-newly-announced-jack-o-in-dlc-trailer"><span style="color:#f39c12;">dropped</span></a> a few days, bringing back a fan-favorite character&nbsp;Jack O&#39;, the internet has been littered with fan art of their own favorite characters striking the top-down pose that&nbsp;Jack O&#39; is now known for.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the art has been wholesome &ndash; some, not so &ndash; but I think I&#39;d be remiss to say they haven&#39;t all been wonderful. While the trend may have started in the west, it has wide and far to all across the globe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For reference, here is the pose from&nbsp;<em><strong>Guilty Gear:</strong></em></p>

<p>But, showing every up was none other than&nbsp;Namihei Isono from the long-running family anime&nbsp;<em><strong>Sazae-san</strong></em> who has been trying out the stretch (why else would you make the pose after all?) for at least 30 years at his local bathhouse. Pretty spry for a&nbsp;54-year-old salaryman!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second trailer is here for <b><i>Metroid Dread</i></b>, which makes its long-awaited debut on Switch this October. In this one, Nintendo is here to show off more of Samus&#39;s abilities along with some of the mysterious new enemies she&#39;ll be using them against, so see what&#39;s in store on Planet ZDR below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nintendo breaks down the abilities:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Flash Shift</b>&nbsp;&ndash; This all-new Aeion Ability lets Samus travel a set distance &ndash; forward or backward, while on the ground or in the air &ndash; in an instant.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Pulse Radar</b>&nbsp;&ndash;This handy Aeion Ability allows Samus to scan her immediate surroundings and pinpoint breakable blocks.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Grapple Beam</b>&nbsp;&ndash; A rope-like beam that can connect to specific points, the Grapple Beam allows Samus to swing across gaps or manipulate parts of her environment, such as pulling an object.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ice Missile</b>&nbsp;&ndash; By using this&nbsp;<i>cool</i>&nbsp;upgrade, Samus can freeze enemies to easily destroy them or even use some of them as platforms!</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Storm Missile</b>&nbsp;&ndash; With the Storm Missiles, Samus can lock on to and fire multiple small missiles in succession.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cross Bomb</b>&nbsp;&ndash; This powerful bomb explodes in four directions.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Speed Booster</b>&nbsp;&ndash; This ability allows her to run at great speed, dealing damage to enemies and smashing through certain walls.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shinespark</b>&nbsp;&ndash; True&nbsp;<i>Metroid</i>&nbsp;experts know all about this electrifying move, which can be activated to have Samus fly in a set direction while in her Speed Booster state.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Screw Attack</b>&nbsp;&ndash; A classic move that has been in every single 2D&nbsp;<i>Metroid</i>&nbsp;game, the Screw Attack finds Samus damaging enemies and shattering certain obstacles during a spin jump.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Metroid Dread </i></b>hits Nintendo Switch on October 8.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beware of unsolicited head pats, because a new trailer has been released for <strong><em>My Senpai is Annoying</em></strong> (known in Japan as <em>Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi</em>), an upcoming TV anime based on the romantic office comedy manga by Shiromanta about a tiny office lady who develops complicated feelings for her loud, brash, and blunt superior.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6jHQlaQXQSs" title="YouTube video player" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The original <strong><em>My Senpai is Annoying</em></strong> web comic is serialized in Pixiv&#39;s <span style="color: #ff9900;"><a href="https://comic.pixiv.net/works/4862" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff9900;">comic POOL</span></a></span> digital manga magazine, and an <a href="https://sevenseasentertainment.com/series/my-senpai-is-annoying/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#f39c12;">English language version</span></a> is also published in print by Seven Seas Entertainment, who describe the story of the series as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Igarashi is a hardworking young office lady. Takeda, the senpai above her at work, annoys her constantly&ndash;and yet she finds herself growing closer to him. Every day is filled with comic mishaps and romantic moments as Igarashi tries to balance work, life, and love.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="A new key visual for the upcoming My Senpai is Annoying TV anime, featuring the main cast posing for the camera with their fists raised. Harumi has hoisted Futaba into the air, and she's braced on his shoulder as if she were sitting in an office chair." src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/2b65b53d138f21f11467bdf30d23f5371628690221_main.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 905px;" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong><em>My Senpai is Annoying</em></strong> TV anime is directed by Ryota Ito and features animation production by Doga Kobo. The series is scheduled to begin broadcasting in Japan according to the following TV schedule:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>TOKYO MX: every Saturday during the 25:00 time slot beginning on October 09, 2021.</li>

While getting dragged into dealing with these cases every day, they run into a cold-blooded murder case. Enjoy a new kind of horror mystery created by total opposites.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>BELLE</strong></em>&nbsp;will be released in Japanese theaters on July 16, with GKIDS bringing the film stateside sometime in Winter 2021. The film has already <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2021/08/20-1/mamoru-hosodas-belle-takes-center-stage-as-it-moves-past-5-billion-yen-at-jp-box-office"><span style="color:#f39c12;">surpassed</span></a> 5 billion yen&nbsp;(US$45.52 million) in Japanese theaters, making it the second-highest-grossing film directed by Mamoru Hosoda. GKIDS describes the film as such:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Suzu, a 17-year-old schoolgirl, lives with her father in a village surrounded by nature in Kochi prefecture after her mother died in an accident when she was a little girl. Suzu used to love singing with her mother more than anything else, but after her death, she has not been able to sing.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Writing songs is the only thing that gives Suzu any comfort until one day she is invited by her best friend to enter a virtual community in the Internet called U with over 5 billion members worldwide. In U, she can live another life as an AS, which is what avatars are called there. Although Suzu can&rsquo;t sing in real life, singing comes natural to her in U as an AS known as Belle. Belle quickly captures the attention of U&rsquo;s citizens with her songs and becomes a worldwide superstar diva.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>The day of Belle&rsquo;s huge concert viewed by millions of AS around the world&mdash; A mysterious presence known as the Dragon suddenly bursts into the concert hall. Her concert is ruined by the violent, arrogant Dragon. Belle, who wants to know why the Dragon suffers so much pain, approaches him. Dragon, on the other hand, slowly opens his heart to Belle&rsquo;s gentle singing voice.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Soon, the search for the Dragon&rsquo;s identity (unveiling) starts around the world.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>A group of AS who claim to be the protectors of justice start their relentless pursuit of the Dragon who they believe disrupts order in U. The Dragon becomes the target of trolling and abuse both in U and the real world. The more people persecute him in both worlds, the more Belle feels stronger to find him and heal his heart.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Will Suzu&rsquo;s voice from a remote corner in the real world reach this single, unknown individual in a world of billions? A miracle occurs when the two worlds merge into one.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Another reality. Another you. You&rsquo;re not alone anymore.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The official website for the six-part OVA series <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><a href="http://girls-und-panzer-finale.jp/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff9900;"><em>Girls und Panzer das Finale</em></span></a></strong></span> announced today that the latest third chapter will be screened in 78 4DX/MX4D theaters across Japan from October 8 and its DVD/Blu-ray will be released on December 24.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4D is an attraction-like experiential viewing style, where you can feel the chairs move, vibrations, wind, rain, water splashes, smells, and various effects according to the content of the film. 4DX is a product of CJ 4DPLEX, a Korean company, while MX4D was developed by Media Motion in Los Angeles, USA.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the very successful first two chapters in December 2017 and June 2019, the much-awaited 48-minute third chapter was released in 65 theaters on March 26, 2021, and has earned 470 million yen (4.27 million USD) from its domestic run so far. 4D screenings with high ticket prices are expected to further add to box office revenues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/7565504e2e92ee5c0dfed3aa80637d3b1630029730_main.jpg" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is officially announced today that 22-year-old <strong>Kanna Hashimoto</strong> (Kagura in the <em>Gintama</em> live-action film series) is set to star in <a href="https://wwws.warnerbros.co.jp/karadasagashijp/"><span style="color:#f39c12;">the forthcoming live-action film adaptation</span></a> of Welzard&#39;s supernatural survival horror novel <em><strong>Karada Sagsahi</strong></em> (<em>Searching for the Body</em>). The film will be directed by <strong>Eiichiro Hazumi</strong> (<em>Umizaru</em> series), and it has been six years since he worked with Hashimoto on the 2016 live-action film&nbsp;<em><strong>Assassination Classroom: Graduation</strong></em>, in which she played Autonomous Intelligence Fixed Artillery &quot;Ritsu.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The original novel was first posted on the novel posting site EVERYSTAR in 2002, then its manga version illustrated by Katsutoshi Murase was serialized in Shueisha&#39;s Shonen Jump + digital manga magazine from 2014 to 2019, and became the first popular series to surpass 100 million views. In addition, its short-form web anime was distributed via Production I.G&#39;s &quot;Tate Anime&quot; smart phone app in 2017.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The story centers on a high school student, Asuka Morisaki. She is told by a young girl who is not supposed to be at her school, &quot;Search my body,&quot; on July 5. The moment midnight struck, she found herself in a school in the middle of the night. There was Takahiro, a childhood friend who had become distant, and four other classmates with whom she has not been familiar with. The six of them don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but then suddenly a girl with blood all over her body called &quot;Red Person&quot; appears and slaughters them all. Just when everything seemed to be over, Asuka woke up in her bed. It was the morning of July 5.&nbsp;She and five&nbsp;others, who are repeatedly killed by the &quot;Red Person&quot; on July 5, try to find all the dismembered &quot;bodies&quot; of the girl hidden in the school in order to break out of the loop and to face tomorrow (July 6).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kanna Hashimoto says,&nbsp; &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to working with director Hazumi, who will be directing &#39;Karada Sagashi,&#39; in which I will be playing the lead role, for the first time in six years since &#39;Assassination Classroom: Graduation&#39;&nbsp;released in 2016. This film is not just a horror film, but also has many action scenes that will keep your eyes on it until the end to see how it ends. I hope that everyone will pay attention to it.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The live-action film <em><strong>Karada Sagashi</strong></em> is now in the works for a release in 2022.</p>

<p>On the heels of the second&nbsp;<em><strong>Macross Delta&nbsp;</strong></em>movie, galactic idols Ranka Lee (<strong>Megumi Nakajima</strong>) and Sheryl Nome (<strong>May&#39;n</strong>) are making their own much-anticipated return. Today, we&#39;ve got more information on the duo&#39;s upcoming concert, as well as the theme song for the upcoming short film&nbsp;<strong><em>Labyrinth of Time</em></strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>SANKYO Presents Macross F GALAXY LIVE 2021 [Revenge]&nbsp;</b>is scheduled to take place&nbsp;<strong>November 9</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>November 10&nbsp;</strong>at Makuhari Event Hall. The concert marks the first&nbsp;<em><strong>Macross Frontier</strong></em>-specific concert since December 2010&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>Merry Christmas Without You</strong>&nbsp;event, and the first time the two have performed together onstage since the franchise&#39;s crossover concert in 2019.</p>

   <title>Product Designer Behind North American NES and SNES Designs Formally Retires From Nintendo</title>
   <author>Humberto Saabedra</author>
   <description>Lance Barr featured in Netflix doc High Score about the rise of the video game industry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/9669f3b627bb54c77ff02db764a7ee261629998944_thumb.jpg"  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 38 years, the unsung designer that ended up directly impacting&amp;nbsp;the North American success of Nintendo&amp;#39;s first and second home video game consoles released in the US in the Nintendo and Super Nintendo Entertainment System is retiring. Read on for the details on his impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
</description>
   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/4832688791425b1c0c1abdf94ccb58571629997302_main.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 462px;" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">NES Control Deck from 1986</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>For video game players of a certain age in the United States, the Nintendo Entertainment System that was a fixture in so many homes from the mid-80s to the mid-90s was the result of a last-minute redesign request from former Nintendo of America President&nbsp;Minoru Arakawa. The man responsible for the&nbsp;front-loading&nbsp;system redesign that led to American consumers readily adopting the console is none other than industrial designer Lance Barr, who also shares credit for the redesign that led to the North American Super Nintendo Entertainment System.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/1d1f0765ce217bd13dbe99e2be69f4411629997493_main.png" style="width: 640px; height: 311px;" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Super Nintendo</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of today, Lance Barr is no longer actively workling at Nintendo or even in the industry, changing his status on his LinkedIn page to Retired and remarking that he looks forward to new projects outside of video game hardware design. Barr also lent his input to the final design of the Nintendo Wii, including the iconic Nunchuck controller, as well as various peripherals over the decades. While not being nearly as visible as some of Nintendo&#39;s better known and more visible corporate officers and personalities, Barr&#39;s impact on the overall success of Nintendo&#39;s entry into video&nbsp;games in the US cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/be9a4bd6b408ec47afd8d34ba81a204a1629997767_main.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 640px;" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Nintendo Wii</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There have been&nbsp;books published on Lance Barr&#39;s place in the rise of the video game industry such as&nbsp;<em>Game Over: How Nintendo Conquered the World&nbsp;</em>as well as his recent participation in the highly regarded Netflix documentary<em> High Score</em>, which details the rise of the video game industry and details Barr&#39;s impact on the success of Nintendo&#39;s first video game console released in the US after the Video Game Crash of 1983. If you have any interest at all on how Nintendo managed to revive a nearly dead video game industry in the US after the industry was all but declared dead, both are solid starting points.</p>

   <title>FEATURE: The Secret To Golgo 13’s Continued Popularity After More Than 50 Years</title>
   <author>Cezary Strusiewicz</author>
   <description>How a manga that remained largely unchanged for half a century broke the record for most volumes published&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/a0313c597d85c15d9a5f9d2dfcf51de61628495733_thumb.png"  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Golgo 13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the story of an international assassin for hire, is currently the Guinness World Record holder for the largest number of volumes published. How exactly did this comic remain popular for half a century? Hit the jump button to find out the answer.&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Golgo 13" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/3fb6ba50ead82d0bdedb61c378fd9cbe1628495453_main.png" style="width: 640px; height: 361px;" /><br />
<em><span style="font-size:11px;">Image via <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/bC76RcOIQas"><span style="color:#f39c12;">MOFA</span></a></strong></span></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On July 5, Takao Saito&rsquo;s <strong><em>Golgo 13</em></strong> officially became the <strong><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2021/07/05/entertainment-news/golgo-13-record/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Guinness World Record holder</span></a></strong> for most volumes published for a single manga series. Since April, the manga was actually tied for the title with Osamu Akimoto&rsquo;s cop comedy <em><strong>Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Koen Mae Hashutsujo</strong></em>, but once Saito&rsquo;s 201st volume hit the shelves, it put the manga over the top. &ldquo;Over the top&rdquo; is also a good way to describe <em><strong>Golgo 13</strong></em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The comic tells the story of international sniper-assassin-for-hire Duke Togo, who goes by the moniker &ldquo;Golgo 13,&rdquo; a nickname taken from &ldquo;<strong><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-02-27-8601150379-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Golgotha</span></a></strong>&rdquo; (the site of Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion). &ldquo;13&rdquo; is of course the total number of times the expert marksman missed during the 50 years he&rsquo;s been killing people for money. Actually, that number is there to make him look cooler, as if his logo of a skeleton with a crown of thorns wasn&rsquo;t already doing that. That&rsquo;s the thing about Duke and all of <em><strong>Golgo 13 </strong></em>really. It technically takes place in the real world&nbsp;but similar to, say, the Bond movies, it slaps a nice, thick layer of exaggeration, improbable action, and outlandish villains on top of it all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Duke Togo, Golgo 13" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/d36c9950e4b296f305b90bdaf045d6e51628495537_main.png" style="width: 640px; height: 202px;" /><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><em>Image via <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/kXw42-1BYUA" target="_blank"><span style="color:#f39c12;">MOFA</span></a></strong></em></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Duke Togo is &hellip; not a boring character, nor a generic one. In fact, his bushy eyebrows and glorious sideburns have become as iconic in Japan as, say, Clark Kent&rsquo;s little hair curl is in the US. But after all these years, we still don&rsquo;t really know anything about him. &ldquo;Duke Togo&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t even his real name; it&rsquo;s just a moniker he uses the most. The comic had characters get close to Duke&rsquo;s real identity but it always ended in a dead-end, with an emphasis on &ldquo;dead.&rdquo; The character also doesn&rsquo;t say much and has the same look on his face working as an assassin or drinking coffee. That&rsquo;s because Duke Togo is one of the finest examples of the blank slate protagonist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Duke Togo, Golgo 13" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/5e20fc7d84d80c6969b7471d2faf4adb1628495582_main.png" style="width: 640px; height: 361px;" /><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><em>Image via <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/QQf_pIaio34" target="_blank"><span style="color:#f39c12;">MOFA</span></a></strong></em></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most stories like to keep their main characters somewhat underdefined so we can project ourselves onto them. Duke very much has a personality, mind you. For example, he&rsquo;s very methodical, hard-working, and never breaks a contract, but different people will see vastly different things in him because of how little he gives us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This kind of storytelling technique where everything except the main character has to hold your attention is very tricky to pull off, but <em><strong>Golgo 13</strong></em> has never struggled with this. The comic takes Duke all over the world, from Switzerland to Palestine, South Africa, Japan, or the United States, where he meets people from all walks of life. All of these locales, people, and the conflicts they&rsquo;re involved in are very well-researched, beautifully illustrated, and are the true heart of the comic. Ultimately, Duke Togo is just a tool&nbsp;these side characters use &mdash; how they use him reveals a lot about them, like their personalities or beliefs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Locations in Golgo 13" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/3a37a6a823a5b31b41de3d0ee8afbf151628495650_main.png" style="width: 640px; height: 361px;" /><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><em>Image via <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/QQf_pIaio34" target="_blank"><span style="color:#f39c12;">MOFA</span></a></strong></em></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, <em><strong>Golgo 13</strong></em> is just an easy comic to get into. Most of its stories are completely self-contained, though some of the details like the existence of East and West Germany date some of them. Add to that an art style that virtually didn&rsquo;t change since Volume 1 and you have yourself a read that offers inventive action (you ever seen a sniper bounce a bullet off water?), international settings, and cool side characters, and all of that without the need to do any homework. All you need to know is this: &ldquo;They call him &lsquo;Golgo 13.&rsquo; He kills for money with a modified M16.&rdquo; There. Now you can join the millions of people who have been following Duke&rsquo;s adventures since the mid-20th century. You can literally start anywhere you want. That&rsquo;s the beauty of <em><strong>Golgo 13</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Crunchyroll describes the story of <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/restaurant-to-another-world?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=article_driven&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_news_article_driven"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong><em>Restaurant to Another World</em></strong></span></a> as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>There is a certain restaurant in the first basement level of a multi-tenant building in one corner of a shopping street near the office district. The historical restaurant, marked by a sign with a picture of a cat, is called &quot;Western Cuisine Nekoya.&quot; This restaurant looks completely normal through the week, but on Saturdays, it opens in secret exclusively to some very unique guests. During these hours, doors in various areas of a parallel world open to allow customers of many different races and cultures into the restaurant.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Fardania, a wood elf, gathers mushrooms and herbs in a wooded glade near a doorway leading to the Nekoya restaurant in a new key visual for the upcoming second season of the Restaurant to Another World TV anime." src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/739d6c71f8ffda78c0d01ceba10c73471629978388_main.jpg" style="width: 504px; height: 700px;" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/restaurant-to-another-world?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=article_driven&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_news_article_driven"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong><em>Restaurant to Another World</em></strong></span></a> is directed by Masato Jinbo and features animation production by OLM. The second season of the series will stream on Crunchyroll, and it is scheduled to broadcast in Japan according to the following schedule:</p>

<ul>
	<li>TV Tokyo: every Friday during the 25:23 time slot beginning on October 01, 2021. (The broadcast of the first episode only will be at 25:38.)</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trailer was set to be released last week, but due to the theme song artists&nbsp;<strong>OLDCODEX</strong> being on break due to one of the members&nbsp;<strong>Tatsuhisa Suzuki</strong>, who also voices&nbsp;Makoto in the franchise, being on break for&nbsp;&quot;physical and mental fatigue,&quot; it was <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2021/08/17-1/free-the-final-stroke-cancels-august-19-trailer-release-due-to-oldcodex-being-on-break"><span style="color:#f39c12;">delayed</span></a> while they reworked the theme song out of the trailer. The trailer was originally cut around the song, which was omitted from the released version.</p>

<p>The Japanese Pok&eacute;mon Center website <a href="https://voice.pokemon.co.jp/stv/zenten/2021/08/post-11367.html"><span style="color:#f39c12;">announced</span></a> today that from August 28, <strong>all physical Pok&eacute;mon Center, Pok&eacute;mon Cafe,&nbsp;Pikachu Sweets, and Pok&eacute;mon stores will be closed in State of Emergency areas to combat the rising cases of COVID-19</strong> as the Delta variant spreads widely across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously the stores closed when the government requested closures in the first State of Emergency, but since then the central and prefectural governments have been haphazard with requests to close, with some areas only having department stores open during the week, or closing early. It is not mentioned when the stores and eateries will re-open, but assumably it&#39;ll be when the State of Emergency declaration ends.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Pok&eacute;mon</strong></em> have taken it upon themselves to close during this current State of Emergency, which expands&nbsp;to&nbsp;Hokkaido, Miyagi, Gifu, Aichi, Mie, Shiga, Okayama, and Hiroshima this on Friday and already included&nbsp;Tokyo, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Fukuoka and Okinawa prefectures. It is scheduled to end on September 12 if indicators lower.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you played Hideo Kojima&#39;s <b><i>Death Stranding </i></b>in its original form, you know how grueling it could be&nbsp;to traverse the landscape and deliver packages safely while trying to survive. The upcoming <b><i>Death Stranding: Director&#39;s Cut </i></b>version aims to add some quality of life features in addition to a bunch of new content, from additional vehicles to new locations like a firing range and racetrack, complete with minigames.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lengthy new trailer is here to show it all off, and you can see the nine-minute showcase in English and Japanese below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the PS5 upgrades like fast loading, enhanced visuals, haptic feedback, and 3D audio on compatible headphones, here are the key features:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Remastered for the PlayStation 5 Console</b>&nbsp;&ndash; Take on the trials of Sam Bridges with advanced combat, more character actions and a competitive ranking system for special player challenges in this definitive&nbsp;<i>Death Stranding</i>&nbsp;experience.</li>

   <title>Japan’s Top Cosplayer Enako Reveals She Makes Nothing From Magazine Photoshoots</title>

   <description>The cosplayer broke down her payments for a variety program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/d8a4aa5961a54bc3523932587d9028f91629967581_thumb.png"  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you go into a convenience store right across Japan, you&amp;#39;ll find the face of Japan&amp;#39;s top cosplayer Enako smiling at you from multiple magazine covers on the shelves. While many would think that Enako was making a killing off all the photoshoots, the cosplayer revealed on variety program Shimofuri MikiXIT on Monday night that she actually earned nothing from them. 0 whole yen! Find out why after the jump!&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
</description>
   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Hololive Alternative" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/6152ce51fbda6ebcfccee4fd511118261628151069_main.jpg" style="height: 360px; width: 640px;" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you go into a convenience store right across Japan, you&#39;ll find the face of Japan&#39;s top cosplayer <strong>Enako</strong> smiling at you from multiple magazine covers on the shelves. While many would think that <strong>Enako</strong> was making a killing off all the photoshoots, the cosplayer <a href="https://www.daily.co.jp/gossip/2021/08/24/0014618697.shtml"><span style="color:#f39c12;">revealed</span></a> on variety program <em>Shimofuri MikiXIT</em> on Monday night that she actually earned nothing from them. <strong>0 whole yen.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Enako</strong> as VTuber Marine on the cover of&nbsp;<em>Weekly Young Jump</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Weekly Young Jump" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/a7c408de3abe9fe3647c96ea60f8050a1628151103_main.jpg" style="height: 905px; width: 640px;" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the worry that these magazines were shortchanging the cosplayer when other gravure idols are usually paid for the photoshoot, <strong>Enako</strong> clarified that she actually saw the shoots as promotion for her own work and believes that the partnership is mutually beneficial for both parties.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Enako</strong> explained that she earns 70 percent of&nbsp;her <strong>50 million yen (US$453,660) yearly income</strong> from corporate sponsorships, event hosting, and commercials, and the other 30 percent comes from her own photobooks, which she sells online and at events like Comiket (when they&#39;re running), which in normal times could make her 10 million yen (US$90,737) per day. <strong>Enako</strong> is currently contracted to around 8 companies at this time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Enako as Tohru from&nbsp;<b><i><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/miss-kobayashis-dragon-maid?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=article_driven&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_news_article_driven"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Miss Kobayashi&#39;s Dragon Maid</span></a>&nbsp;</i></b>on the cover of&nbsp;<em>Monthly Action</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid x Enako" src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/c3101a98625e905076d755e17353d3ed1627283862_main.jpg" style="height: 919px; width: 640px;" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a professional cosplay trailblazer, it&#39;s great that <strong>Enako</strong> is being open about how much she makes and how she makes it, but hopefully, companies don&#39;t think that every cosplayer will let them photoshoot them for free. Until then though, looks like we&#39;ll be seeing a lot more of Japan&#39;s top cosplayer.</p>
